He is, without doubt, the largest inhabitant of the globe;\\nthe most formidable of all whales to encounter; the most majestic in\\naspect; and lastly, by far the most valuable in commerce; he being the\\nonly creature from which that valuable substance, spermaceti, is\\nobtained. All his peculiarities will, in many other places, be enlarged\\nupon. It is chiefly with his name that I now have to do. Philologically\\nconsidered, it is absurd. Some centuries ago, when the Sperm whale was\\nalmost wholly unknown in his own proper individuality, and when his oil\\nwas only accidentally obtained from the stranded fish; in those days\\nspermaceti, it would seem, was popularly supposed to be derived from a\\ncreature identical with the one then known in England as the Greenland\\nor Right Whale. It was the idea also, that this same spermaceti was\\nthat quickening humor of the Greenland Whale which the first syllable\\nof the word literally expresses. In those times, also, spermaceti was\\nexceedingly scarce, not being used for light, but only as an ointment\\nand medicament. It was only to be had from the druggists as you\\nnowadays buy an ounce of rhubarb. When, as I opine, in the course of\\ntime, the true nature of spermaceti became known, its original name was\\nstill retained by the dealers; no doubt to enhance its value by a\\nnotion so strangely significant of its scarcity. And so the appellation\\nmust at last have come to be bestowed upon the whale from which this\\nspermaceti was really derived.'),\n",

It yields the article commonly known as whalebone or\\nbaleen; and the oil specially known as “whale oil,” an inferior article\\nin commerce. Among the fishermen, he is indiscriminately designated by\\nall the following titles: The Whale; the Greenland Whale; the Black\\nWhale; the Great Whale; the True Whale; the Right Whale. There is a\\ndeal of obscurity concerning the identity of the species thus\\nmultitudinously baptised. What then is the whale, which I include in\\nthe second species of my Folios? It is the Great Mysticetus of the\\nEnglish naturalists; the Greenland Whale of the English whalemen; the\\nBaleine Ordinaire of the French whalemen; the Growlands Walfish of the\\nSwedes. It is the whale which for more than two centuries past has been\\nhunted by the Dutch and English in the Arctic seas; it is the whale\\nwhich the American fishermen have long pursued in the Indian ocean, on\\nthe Brazil Banks, on the Nor’ West Coast, and various other parts of\\nthe world, designated by them Right Whale Cruising Grounds.'),\n",

       "  '(_Fin-Back_).—Under this head I reckon\\na monster which, by the various names of Fin-Back, Tall-Spout, and\\nLong-John, has been seen almost in every sea and is commonly the whale\\nwhose distant jet is so often descried by passengers crossing the\\nAtlantic, in the New York packet-tracks. In the length he attains, and\\nin his baleen, the Fin-back resembles the right whale, but is of a less\\nportly girth, and a lighter colour, approaching to olive. His great\\nlips present a cable-like aspect, formed by the intertwisting, slanting\\nfolds of large wrinkles. His grand distinguishing feature, the fin,\\nfrom which he derives his name, is often a conspicuous object. This fin\\nis some three or four feet long, growing vertically from the hinder\\npart of the back, of an angular shape, and with a very sharp pointed\\nend. Even if not the slightest other part of the creature be visible,\\nthis isolated fin will, at times, be seen plainly projecting from the\\nsurface. When the sea is moderately calm, and slightly marked with\\nspherical ripples, and this gnomon-like fin stands up and casts shadows\\nupon the wrinkled surface, it may well be supposed that the watery\\ncircle surrounding it somewhat resembles a dial, with its style and\\nwavy hour-lines graved on it. On that Ahaz-dial the shadow often goes\\nback. The Fin-Back is not gregarious. He seems a whale-hater, as some\\nmen are man-haters. Very shy; always going solitary; unexpectedly\\nrising to the surface in the remotest and most sullen waters; his\\nstraight and single lofty jet rising like a tall misanthropic spear\\nupon a barren plain; gifted with such wondrous power and velocity in\\nswimming, as to defy all present pursuit from man; this leviathan seems\\nthe banished and unconquerable Cain of his race, bearing for his mark\\nthat style upon his back. From having the baleen in his mouth, the\\nFin-Back is sometimes included with the right whale, among a theoretic\\nspecies denominated _Whalebone whales_, that is, whales with baleen. Of\\nthese so called Whalebone whales, there would seem to be several\\nvarieties, most of which, however, are little known. Broad-nosed whales\\nand beaked whales; pike-headed whales; bunched whales; under-jawed\\nwhales and rostrated whales, are the fishermen’s names for a few sorts.'),\n",
       " ('IV',\n",
       "  '(_Hump Back_).—This whale is often seen\\non the northern American coast. He has been frequently captured there,\\nand towed into harbor. He has a great pack on him like a peddler; or\\nyou might call him the Elephant and Castle whale. At any rate, the\\npopular name for him does not sufficiently distinguish him, since the\\nsperm whale also has a hump though a smaller one. His oil is not very\\nvaluable. He has baleen. He is the most gamesome and light-hearted of\\nall the whales, making more gay foam and white water generally than any\\nother of them.'),\n",
       " ('V',\n",
       "  '(_Razor Back_).—Of this whale little is\\nknown but his name. I have seen him at a distance off Cape Horn. Of a\\nretiring nature, he eludes both hunters and philosophers. Though no\\ncoward, he has never yet shown any part of him but his back, which\\nrises in a long sharp ridge. Let him go. I know little more of him, nor\\ndoes anybody else.'),\n",
       " ('VI',\n",
       "  '(_Sulphur Bottom_).—Another retiring\\ngentleman, with a brimstone belly, doubtless got by scraping along the\\nTartarian tiles in some of his profounder divings. He is seldom seen;\\nat least I have never seen him except in the remoter southern seas, and\\nthen always at too great a distance to study his countenance. He is\\nnever chased; he would run away with rope-walks of line. Prodigies are\\ntold of him. Adieu, Sulphur Bottom! I can say nothing more that is true\\nof ye, nor can the oldest Nantucketer.'),\n",
       " ('I',\n",
       "  '(_Grampus_).—Though this fish, whose\\nloud sonorous breathing, or rather blowing, has furnished a proverb to\\nlandsmen, is so well known a denizen of the deep, yet is he not\\npopularly classed among whales. But possessing all the grand\\ndistinctive features of the leviathan, most naturalists have recognised\\nhim for one. He is of moderate octavo size, varying from fifteen to\\ntwenty-five feet in length, and of corresponding dimensions round the\\nwaist. He swims in herds; he is never regularly hunted, though his oil\\nis considerable in quantity, and pretty good for light. By some\\nfishermen his approach is regarded as premonitory of the advance of the\\ngreat sperm whale.'),\n",
       " ('II',\n",
       "  '(_Black Fish_).—I give the popular\\nfishermen’s names for all these fish, for generally they are the best.\\nWhere any name happens to be vague or inexpressive, I shall say so, and\\nsuggest another. I do so now, touching the Black Fish, so-called,\\nbecause blackness is the rule among almost all whales. So, call him the\\nHyena Whale, if you please. His voracity is well known, and from the\\ncircumstance that the inner angles of his lips are curved upwards, he\\ncarries an everlasting Mephistophelean grin on his face. This whale\\naverages some sixteen or eighteen feet in length. He is found in almost\\nall latitudes. He has a peculiar way of showing his dorsal hooked fin\\nin swimming, which looks something like a Roman nose. When not more\\nprofitably employed, the sperm whale hunters sometimes capture the\\nHyena whale, to keep up the supply of cheap oil for domestic\\nemployment—as some frugal housekeepers, in the absence of company, and\\nquite alone by themselves, burn unsavory tallow instead of odorous wax.\\nThough their blubber is very thin, some of these whales will yield you\\nupwards of thirty gallons of oil.'),\n",
       " ('III',\n",
       "  '(_Narwhale_), that is, _Nostril\\nwhale_.—Another instance of a curiously named whale, so named I suppose\\nfrom his peculiar horn being originally mistaken for a peaked nose. The\\ncreature is some sixteen feet in length, while its horn averages five\\nfeet, though some exceed ten, and even attain to fifteen feet. Strictly\\nspeaking, this horn is but a lengthened tusk, growing out from the jaw\\nin a line a little depressed from the horizontal. But it is only found\\non the sinister side, which has an ill effect, giving its owner\\nsomething analogous to the aspect of a clumsy left-handed man. What\\nprecise purpose this ivory horn or lance answers, it would be hard to\\nsay. It does not seem to be used like the blade of the sword-fish and\\nbill-fish; though some sailors tell me that the Narwhale employs it for\\na rake in turning over the bottom of the sea for food. Charley Coffin\\nsaid it was used for an ice-piercer; for the Narwhale, rising to the\\nsurface of the Polar Sea, and finding it sheeted with ice, thrusts his\\nhorn up, and so breaks through. But you cannot prove either of these\\nsurmises to be correct. My own opinion is, that however this one-sided\\nhorn may really be used by the Narwhale—however that may be—it would\\ncertainly be very convenient to him for a folder in reading pamphlets.\\nThe Narwhale I have heard called the Tusked whale, the Horned whale,\\nand the Unicorn whale. He is certainly a curious example of the\\nUnicornism to be found in almost every kingdom of animated nature. From\\ncertain cloistered old authors I have gathered that this same\\nsea-unicorn’s horn was in ancient days regarded as the great antidote\\nagainst poison, and as such, preparations of it brought immense prices.\\nIt was also distilled to a volatile salts for fainting ladies, the same\\nway that the horns of the male deer are manufactured into hartshorn.\\nOriginally it was in itself accounted an object of great curiosity.\\nBlack Letter tells me that Sir Martin Frobisher on his return from that\\nvoyage, when Queen Bess did gallantly wave her jewelled hand to him\\nfrom a window of Greenwich Palace, as his bold ship sailed down the\\nThames; “when Sir Martin returned from that voyage,” saith Black\\nLetter, “on bended knees he presented to her highness a prodigious long\\nhorn of the Narwhale, which for a long period after hung in the castle\\nat Windsor.” An Irish author avers that the Earl of Leicester, on\\nbended knees, did likewise present to her highness another horn,\\npertaining to a land beast of the unicorn nature.'),\n",
       " ('IV',\n",
       "  '(_Killer_).—Of this whale little is\\nprecisely known to the Nantucketer, and nothing at all to the professed\\nnaturalist. From what I have seen of him at a distance, I should say\\nthat he was about the bigness of a grampus. He is very savage—a sort of\\nFeegee fish. He sometimes takes the great Folio whales by the lip, and\\nhangs there like a leech, till the mighty brute is worried to death.\\nThe Killer is never hunted. I never heard what sort of oil he has.\\nException might be taken to the name bestowed upon this whale, on the\\nground of its indistinctness. For we are all killers, on land and on\\nsea; Bonapartes and Sharks included.'),\n",
       " ('V',\n",
       "  '(_Thrasher_).—This gentleman is famous\\nfor his tail, which he uses for a ferule in thrashing his foes. He\\nmounts the Folio whale’s back, and as he swims, he works his passage by\\nflogging him; as some schoolmasters get along in the world by a similar\\nprocess. Still less is known of the Thrasher than of the Killer. Both\\nare outlaws, even in the lawless seas.'),\n",
       " ('1',\n",
       "  '(_Huzza Porpoise_).—This is the\\ncommon porpoise found almost all over the globe. The name is of my own\\nbestowal; for there are more than one sort of porpoises, and something\\nmust be done to distinguish them. I call him thus, because he always\\nswims in hilarious shoals, which upon the broad sea keep tossing\\nthemselves to heaven like caps in a Fourth-of-July crowd. Their\\nappearance is generally hailed with delight by the mariner. Full of\\nfine spirits, they invariably come from the breezy billows to windward.\\nThey are the lads that always live before the wind. They are accounted\\na lucky omen. If you yourself can withstand three cheers at beholding\\nthese vivacious fish, then heaven help ye; the spirit of godly\\ngamesomeness is not in ye. A well-fed, plump Huzza Porpoise will yield\\nyou one good gallon of good oil. But the fine and delicate fluid\\nextracted from his jaws is exceedingly valuable. It is in request among\\njewellers and watchmakers. Sailors put it on their hones. Porpoise meat\\nis good eating, you know. It may never have occurred to you that a\\nporpoise spouts. Indeed, his spout is so small that it is not very\\nreadily discernible. But the next time you have a chance, watch him;\\nand you will then see the great Sperm whale himself in miniature.'),\n",
       " ('II',\n",
       "  '(_Algerine Porpoise_).—A pirate.\\nVery savage. He is only found, I think, in the Pacific. He is somewhat\\nlarger than the Huzza Porpoise, but much of the same general make.\\nProvoke him, and he will buckle to a shark. I have lowered for him many\\ntimes, but never yet saw him captured.'),\n",
       " ('III',\n",
       "  '(_Mealy-mouthed Porpoise_).—The\\nlargest kind of Porpoise; and only found in the Pacific, so far as it\\nis known. The only English name, by which he has hitherto been\\ndesignated, is that of the fishers—Right-Whale Porpoise, from the\\ncircumstance that he is chiefly found in the vicinity of that Folio. In\\nshape, he differs in some degree from the Huzza Porpoise, being of a\\nless rotund and jolly girth; indeed, he is of quite a neat and\\ngentleman-like figure. He has no fins on his back (most other porpoises\\nhave), he has a lovely tail, and sentimental Indian eyes of a hazel\\nhue. But his mealy-mouth spoils all. Though his entire back down to his\\nside fins is of a deep sable, yet a boundary line, distinct as the mark\\nin a ship’s hull, called the “bright waist,” that line streaks him from\\nstem to stern, with two separate colours, black above and white below.\\nThe white comprises part of his head, and the whole of his mouth, which\\nmakes him look as if he had just escaped from a felonious visit to a\\nmeal-bag. A most mean and mealy aspect! His oil is much like that of\\nthe common porpoise.'),\n",

       "  '(_Sperm Whale_).—This whale, among the\\nEnglish of old vaguely known as the Trumpa whale, and the Physeter\\nwhale, and the Anvil Headed whale, is the present Cachalot of the\\nFrench, and the Pottsfich of the Germans, and the Macrocephalus of the\\nLong Words. He is, without doubt, the largest inhabitant of the globe;\\nthe most formidable of all whales to encounter; the most majestic in\\naspect; and lastly, by far the most valuable in commerce; he being the\\nonly creature from which that valuable substance, spermaceti, is\\nobtained. All his peculiarities will, in many other places, be enlarged\\nupon. It is chiefly with his name that I now have to do. Philologically\\nconsidered, it is absurd. Some centuries ago, when the Sperm whale was\\nalmost wholly unknown in his own proper individuality, and when his oil\\nwas only accidentally obtained from the stranded fish; in those days\\nspermaceti, it would seem, was popularly supposed to be derived from a\\ncreature identical with the one then known in England as the Greenland\\nor Right Whale. It was the idea also, that this same spermaceti was\\nthat quickening humor of the Greenland Whale which the first syllable\\nof the word literally expresses. In those times, also, spermaceti was\\nexceedingly scarce, not being used for light, but only as an ointment\\nand medicament. It was only to be had from the druggists as you\\nnowadays buy an ounce of rhubarb. When, as I opine, in the course of\\ntime, the true nature of spermaceti became known, its original name was\\nstill retained by the dealers; no doubt to enhance its value by a\\nnotion so strangely significant of its scarcity. And so the appellation\\nmust at last have come to be bestowed upon the whale from which this\\nspermaceti was really derived.'],\n",
       " ['II',\n",
       "  '(_Right Whale_).—In one respect this is\\nthe most venerable of the leviathans, being the one first regularly\\nhunted by man. It yields the article commonly known as whalebone or\\nbaleen; and the oil specially known as “whale oil,” an inferior article\\nin commerce. Among the fishermen, he is indiscriminately designated by\\nall the following titles: The Whale; the Greenland Whale; the Black\\nWhale; the Great Whale; the True Whale; the Right Whale. There is a\\ndeal of obscurity concerning the identity of the species thus\\nmultitudinously baptised. What then is the whale, which I include in\\nthe second species of my Folios? It is the Great Mysticetus of the\\nEnglish naturalists; the Greenland Whale of the English whalemen; the\\nBaleine Ordinaire of the French whalemen; the Growlands Walfish of the\\nSwedes. It is the whale which for more than two centuries past has been\\nhunted by the Dutch and English in the Arctic seas; it is the whale\\nwhich the American fishermen have long pursued in the Indian ocean, on\\nthe Brazil Banks, on the Nor’ West Coast, and various other parts of\\nthe world, designated by them Right Whale Cruising Grounds.'],\n",
       " ['III',\n",
       "  '(_Fin-Back_).—Under this head I reckon\\na monster which, by the various names of Fin-Back, Tall-Spout, and\\nLong-John, has been seen almost in every sea and is commonly the whale\\nwhose distant jet is so often descried by passengers crossing the\\nAtlantic, in the New York packet-tracks. In the length he attains, and\\nin his baleen, the Fin-back resembles the right whale, but is of a less\\nportly girth, and a lighter colour, approaching to olive. His great\\nlips present a cable-like aspect, formed by the intertwisting, slanting\\nfolds of large wrinkles. His grand distinguishing feature, the fin,\\nfrom which he derives his name, is often a conspicuous object. This fin\\nis some three or four feet long, growing vertically from the hinder\\npart of the back, of an angular shape, and with a very sharp pointed\\nend. Even if not the slightest other part of the creature be visible,\\nthis isolated fin will, at times, be seen plainly projecting from the\\nsurface. When the sea is moderately calm, and slightly marked with\\nspherical ripples, and this gnomon-like fin stands up and casts shadows\\nupon the wrinkled surface, it may well be supposed that the watery\\ncircle surrounding it somewhat resembles a dial, with its style and\\nwavy hour-lines graved on it. On that Ahaz-dial the shadow often goes\\nback. The Fin-Back is not gregarious. He seems a whale-hater, as some\\nmen are man-haters. Very shy; always going solitary; unexpectedly\\nrising to the surface in the remotest and most sullen waters; his\\nstraight and single lofty jet rising like a tall misanthropic spear\\nupon a barren plain; gifted with such wondrous power and velocity in\\nswimming, as to defy all present pursuit from man; this leviathan seems\\nthe banished and unconquerable Cain of his race, bearing for his mark\\nthat style upon his back. From having the baleen in his mouth, the\\nFin-Back is sometimes included with the right whale, among a theoretic\\nspecies denominated _Whalebone whales_, that is, whales with baleen. Of\\nthese so called Whalebone whales, there would seem to be several\\nvarieties, most of which, however, are little known. Broad-nosed whales\\nand beaked whales; pike-headed whales; bunched whales; under-jawed\\nwhales and rostrated whales, are the fishermen’s names for a few sorts.'],\n",
       " ['IV',\n",
       "  '(_Hump Back_).—This whale is often seen\\non the northern American coast. He has been frequently captured there,\\nand towed into harbor. He has a great pack on him like a peddler; or\\nyou might call him the Elephant and Castle whale. At any rate, the\\npopular name for him does not sufficiently distinguish him, since the\\nsperm whale also has a hump though a smaller one. His oil is not very\\nvaluable. He has baleen. He is the most gamesome and light-hearted of\\nall the whales, making more gay foam and white water generally than any\\nother of them.'],\n",
       " ['V',\n",
       "  '(_Razor Back_).—Of this whale little is\\nknown but his name. I have seen him at a distance off Cape Horn. Of a\\nretiring nature, he eludes both hunters and philosophers. Though no\\ncoward, he has never yet shown any part of him but his back, which\\nrises in a long sharp ridge. Let him go. I know little more of him, nor\\ndoes anybody else.'],\n",
       " ['VI',\n",
       "  '(_Sulphur Bottom_).—Another retiring\\ngentleman, with a brimstone belly, doubtless got by scraping along the\\nTartarian tiles in some of his profounder divings. He is seldom seen;\\nat least I have never seen him except in the remoter southern seas, and\\nthen always at too great a distance to study his countenance. He is\\nnever chased; he would run away with rope-walks of line. Prodigies are\\ntold of him. Adieu, Sulphur Bottom! I can say nothing more that is true\\nof ye, nor can the oldest Nantucketer.'],\n",
       " ['I',\n",
       "  '(_Grampus_).—Though this fish, whose\\nloud sonorous breathing, or rather blowing, has furnished a proverb to\\nlandsmen, is so well known a denizen of the deep, yet is he not\\npopularly classed among whales. But possessing all the grand\\ndistinctive features of the leviathan, most naturalists have recognised\\nhim for one. He is of moderate octavo size, varying from fifteen to\\ntwenty-five feet in length, and of corresponding dimensions round the\\nwaist. He swims in herds; he is never regularly hunted, though his oil\\nis considerable in quantity, and pretty good for light. By some\\nfishermen his approach is regarded as premonitory of the advance of the\\ngreat sperm whale.'],\n",
       " ['II',\n",
       "  '(_Black Fish_).—I give the popular\\nfishermen’s names for all these fish, for generally they are the best.\\nWhere any name happens to be vague or inexpressive, I shall say so, and\\nsuggest another. I do so now, touching the Black Fish, so-called,\\nbecause blackness is the rule among almost all whales. So, call him the\\nHyena Whale, if you please. His voracity is well known, and from the\\ncircumstance that the inner angles of his lips are curved upwards, he\\ncarries an everlasting Mephistophelean grin on his face. This whale\\naverages some sixteen or eighteen feet in length. He is found in almost\\nall latitudes. He has a peculiar way of showing his dorsal hooked fin\\nin swimming, which looks something like a Roman nose. When not more\\nprofitably employed, the sperm whale hunters sometimes capture the\\nHyena whale, to keep up the supply of cheap oil for domestic\\nemployment—as some frugal housekeepers, in the absence of company, and\\nquite alone by themselves, burn unsavory tallow instead of odorous wax.\\nThough their blubber is very thin, some of these whales will yield you\\nupwards of thirty gallons of oil.'],\n",
       " ['III',\n",
       "  '(_Narwhale_), that is, _Nostril\\nwhale_.—Another instance of a curiously named whale, so named I suppose\\nfrom his peculiar horn being originally mistaken for a peaked nose. The\\ncreature is some sixteen feet in length, while its horn averages five\\nfeet, though some exceed ten, and even attain to fifteen feet. Strictly\\nspeaking, this horn is but a lengthened tusk, growing out from the jaw\\nin a line a little depressed from the horizontal. But it is only found\\non the sinister side, which has an ill effect, giving its owner\\nsomething analogous to the aspect of a clumsy left-handed man. What\\nprecise purpose this ivory horn or lance answers, it would be hard to\\nsay. It does not seem to be used like the blade of the sword-fish and\\nbill-fish; though some sailors tell me that the Narwhale employs it for\\na rake in turning over the bottom of the sea for food. Charley Coffin\\nsaid it was used for an ice-piercer; for the Narwhale, rising to the\\nsurface of the Polar Sea, and finding it sheeted with ice, thrusts his\\nhorn up, and so breaks through. But you cannot prove either of these\\nsurmises to be correct. My own opinion is, that however this one-sided\\nhorn may really be used by the Narwhale—however that may be—it would\\ncertainly be very convenient to him for a folder in reading pamphlets.\\nThe Narwhale I have heard called the Tusked whale, the Horned whale,\\nand the Unicorn whale. He is certainly a curious example of the\\nUnicornism to be found in almost every kingdom of animated nature. From\\ncertain cloistered old authors I have gathered that this same\\nsea-unicorn’s horn was in ancient days regarded as the great antidote\\nagainst poison, and as such, preparations of it brought immense prices.\\nIt was also distilled to a volatile salts for fainting ladies, the same\\nway that the horns of the male deer are manufactured into hartshorn.\\nOriginally it was in itself accounted an object of great curiosity.\\nBlack Letter tells me that Sir Martin Frobisher on his return from that\\nvoyage, when Queen Bess did gallantly wave her jewelled hand to him\\nfrom a window of Greenwich Palace, as his bold ship sailed down the\\nThames; “when Sir Martin returned from that voyage,” saith Black\\nLetter, “on bended knees he presented to her highness a prodigious long\\nhorn of the Narwhale, which for a long period after hung in the castle\\nat Windsor.” An Irish author avers that the Earl of Leicester, on\\nbended knees, did likewise present to her highness another horn,\\npertaining to a land beast of the unicorn nature.'],\n",
       " ['IV',\n",
       "  '(_Killer_).—Of this whale little is\\nprecisely known to the Nantucketer, and nothing at all to the professed\\nnaturalist. From what I have seen of him at a distance, I should say\\nthat he was about the bigness of a grampus. He is very savage—a sort of\\nFeegee fish. He sometimes takes the great Folio whales by the lip, and\\nhangs there like a leech, till the mighty brute is worried to death.\\nThe Killer is never hunted. I never heard what sort of oil he has.\\nException might be taken to the name bestowed upon this whale, on the\\nground of its indistinctness. For we are all killers, on land and on\\nsea; Bonapartes and Sharks included.'],\n",
       " ['V',\n",
       "  '(_Thrasher_).—This gentleman is famous\\nfor his tail, which he uses for a ferule in thrashing his foes. He\\nmounts the Folio whale’s back, and as he swims, he works his passage by\\nflogging him; as some schoolmasters get along in the world by a similar\\nprocess. Still less is known of the Thrasher than of the Killer. Both\\nare outlaws, even in the lawless seas.'],\n",
       " ['1',\n",
       "  '(_Huzza Porpoise_).—This is the\\ncommon porpoise found almost all over the globe. The name is of my own\\nbestowal; for there are more than one sort of porpoises, and something\\nmust be done to distinguish them. I call him thus, because he always\\nswims in hilarious shoals, which upon the broad sea keep tossing\\nthemselves to heaven like caps in a Fourth-of-July crowd. Their\\nappearance is generally hailed with delight by the mariner. Full of\\nfine spirits, they invariably come from the breezy billows to windward.\\nThey are the lads that always live before the wind. They are accounted\\na lucky omen. If you yourself can withstand three cheers at beholding\\nthese vivacious fish, then heaven help ye; the spirit of godly\\ngamesomeness is not in ye. A well-fed, plump Huzza Porpoise will yield\\nyou one good gallon of good oil. But the fine and delicate fluid\\nextracted from his jaws is exceedingly valuable. It is in request among\\njewellers and watchmakers. Sailors put it on their hones. Porpoise meat\\nis good eating, you know. It may never have occurred to you that a\\nporpoise spouts. Indeed, his spout is so small that it is not very\\nreadily discernible. But the next time you have a chance, watch him;\\nand you will then see the great Sperm whale himself in miniature.'],\n",
       " ['II',\n",
       "  '(_Algerine Porpoise_).—A pirate.\\nVery savage. He is only found, I think, in the Pacific. He is somewhat\\nlarger than the Huzza Porpoise, but much of the same general make.\\nProvoke him, and he will buckle to a shark. I have lowered for him many\\ntimes, but never yet saw him captured.'],\n",
       " ['III',\n",
       "  '(_Mealy-mouthed Porpoise_).—The\\nlargest kind of Porpoise; and only found in the Pacific, so far as it\\nis known. The only English name, by which he has hitherto been\\ndesignated, is that of the fishers—Right-Whale Porpoise, from the\\ncircumstance that he is chiefly found in the vicinity of that Folio. In\\nshape, he differs in some degree from the Huzza Porpoise, being of a\\nless rotund and jolly girth; indeed, he is of quite a neat and\\ngentleman-like figure. He has no fins on his back (most other porpoises\\nhave), he has a lovely tail, and sentimental Indian eyes of a hazel\\nhue. But his mealy-mouth spoils all. Though his entire back down to his\\nside fins is of a deep sable, yet a boundary line, distinct as the mark\\nin a ship’s hull, called the “bright waist,” that line streaks him from\\nstem to stern, with two separate colours, black above and white below.\\nThe white comprises part of his head, and the whole of his mouth, which\\nmakes him look as if he had just escaped from a felonious visit to a\\nmeal-bag. A most mean and mealy aspect! His oil is much like that of\\nthe common porpoise.'],\n",
