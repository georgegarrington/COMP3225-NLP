Offficials failed to capitalise on a  “reachable moment”  with Jaden Moodie, the 14-year-old who was ultimately murdered in gang violence, when he was arrested three months before his death more than 100 miles from his home in possession of 39 wraps of crack cocaine.  Moodie was knocked off his moped and set upon by four youths who stabbed him fatally nine times in January 2019 in the middle of the street in Leyton, east  London .    Poor communication between police forces, delays in processing housing and school applications and weak rules for governing home schooling could have had an impact on his criminal exploitation, said a serious case review by the safeguarding children board of Waltham Forest borough council. 
From the collapse of a happy family to a brutal death: how Jaden Moodie was failed

A “potentially pivotal event” occurred in October 2018 when Moodie, referred to as Child C in the report, was found in a cuckoo house – a property taken over by drug dealers, often inhabited by a vulnerable tenant – in Bournemouth with a 17-year-old from Waltham Forest.  Dorset police found Moodie at the property in personal possession of 39 wraps of crack cocaine, a mobile phone and £325 in cash. He was suspected to be involved in “county lines” drug dealing. After being interviewed in custody, he was ultimately driven back to his grandmother’s home in Waltham Forest at 3am.  The coordination of services between Bournemouth and London was not as strong as it could have been, the report said, calling this a “reachable moment”, based on a concept in education that describes an unplanned chance for a breakthrough with a child.  “The response to Child C while detained in Bournemouth and then on his return from there in October 2018 did not capitalise on a ‘reachable’ moment for a child who was clearly being criminally exploited, and nor was all the information available from the authorities in Bournemouth transferred to their counterparts in Waltham Forest,” the report said.  “While the importance of maximising the potential of reachable moments in working with children is beginning to be recognised, there is as yet no satisfactory approach to covering the whole country when a child who is exposed to ‘county lines’ style operations is found a distance away from their home and so reachable moments are being missed.”  From 2011 to 2018, Moodie and his family were living in Nottinghamshire. From 2016, he began to have a troubled time at secondary school, leading to suspensions and other disciplinary measures. His mother decided to educate him at home from 2017, and he was then at home for more than a year.  However, by the end of the summer of 2017 these arrangements were beginning to break down, eventually leaving Moodie with a lot of unsupervised time, a pattern that repeated at regular intervals for the rest of his life.  In April 2018, his mother decided to move him to Waltham Forest to live initially with his grandmother while she applied to be rehoused in Waltham Forest from Nottinghamshire.  At the time of his death, the 14-year-old was sleeping on a sofa at his maternal grandmother’s house while his mother, who was staying nearby, pursued the housing application.  The serious case review highlighted other significant concerns. Moodie spent all but three of his last 22 months out of school and for much of this there was limited adult guidance or supervision.  “Time spent out of school, for whatever reason, is recognised to constitute a significant risk to children who are vulnerable to criminal exploitation,” the report added.  The report found that current arrangements governing home education contributed to his vulnerability to criminal exploitation.  There was a delay in processing his mother’s application for a place for Moodie at a Waltham Forest high school in May 2018, the report said.  The initial response to his mother’s application for housing in Waltham Forest was slow and no new action was taken after her request that her request for rehousing be reopened by Waltham Forest in August until the end of October 2018.  The report concluded that this could have had an impact on Moodie’s mother’s ability to exercise parental control and supervision over her son.
