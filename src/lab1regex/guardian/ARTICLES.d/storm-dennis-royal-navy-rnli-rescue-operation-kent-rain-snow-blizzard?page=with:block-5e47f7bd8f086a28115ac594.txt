Body found in search for man in sea off Kent coast 
A body has been found after an extensive search operation off the coast of Kent. Lifeboats and the coastguard helicopter had been scouring the sea near Margate harbour after reports of a man overboard, HM Coastguard said.   
HMS Westminster was also believed to have responded to a relay call, and is in the area, according to ship-tracking data. The search operation came as the UK braced for the arrival of Storm Dennis, just one week after Storm Ciara.
