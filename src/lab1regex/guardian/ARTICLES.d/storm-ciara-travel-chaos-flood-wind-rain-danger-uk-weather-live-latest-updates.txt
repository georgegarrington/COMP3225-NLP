Sunday_s developments 
Some areas saw a month and a half‚Äôs rainfall in 24 hours and  gusts of more than 90 miles per hour  swept across the country on Sunday,  bringing widespread flooding.  
Some 539,000 people experienced a power cut on Sunday with 118,000 left without power by 4pm across the whole of the UK, according to Energy Networks. 
Flights, ferries and trains all saw cancellations and delays, while drivers faced treacherous conditions with  floodwater, fallen trees and other debris closing roads.  
Train passengers are being advised to check with operators before travelling as there are likely to be some cancellations to early trains as Network Rail engineers work through the night to assess the damage. 
Motorists are also warned to take care with continued disruption to the road network and tricky driving conditions likely to continue into rush hour. 
British Airways said there will be a ‚Äúminor knock-on effect‚Äù to Monday‚Äôs schedule. 
Sporting fixtures were postponed  including Manchester City‚Äôs Premier League game against West Ham and England‚Äôs women‚Äôs Six Nations match against Scotland in Glasgow. 
More than 200 flood warnings were issued across England on Sunday, with the town of Appleby-in-Westmorland, in Cumbria, severely hit. 
The River Irwell burst its banks at Radcliffe, Greater Manchester, while areas including Blackpool, Whalley, Longton and Rossendale, were affected by flooding in Lancashire. 
The fastest gusts of 97 miles per hour were recorded on the Isle of Wight on Sunday, with 93 miles per hour winds hitting Aberdaron, a village at the tip of the Llyn Peninsula. 
Inland, Manchester Airport recorded gusts of 86 miles per hour, while 178mm of rain fell in Honister Pass, in Cumbria, in the 24 hours to 4pm on Sunday - around one-and-a-half times the average February rainfall of 112mm.
