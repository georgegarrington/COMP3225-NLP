  A coroner 
has called f
or further i
nvestigation
 into whethe
r ingesting 
a toilet fre

o the death 
of a two-yea
r-old girl. 
 Arietta-Gra
ce Barnett w
as taken to 
hospital aft
er possibly 
ingesting th
e Toilet Duc

d vomiting a
 “bright pin

  She was in

ed well enou

hospital but
 was rushed 
back to Sout

 when she be
gan vomiting
 blood and d

last year.  
After a two-

in Wincheste

, the corone

aid Arietta-
Grace was be
lieved to ha
ve swallowed
 a Toilet Du

to stick to 
the toilet b

ts chemicals
.  But Rhode
s-Kemp said 
it had not b
een proven t
hat the corr
osion of the
 girl’s oeso
phagus was c
aused by the
 product.  R
ecording a v
erdict of ac
cidental dea
th, she said
 further inv
estigation w
as needed.  
“The difficu
lty we have 
here is a co
nnection bet
ween that pr
oduct and wh
at happened,
 and it seem
s to me that
 needs furth
er investiga
tion,” she s
aid.  “It is
 designed to
 stick to a 
wet surface 
and not to b
e flushed th
rough by wat
er. If it do
es contain a
gents that c
an cause thi
s sort of co
rrosion and 
this sort of
 death in a 
child then i
t’s very imp
ortant the m
anufacturer 
is aware of 
that, can in
vestigate th
emselves, an
d steps can 
be taken to 
prevent this
 tragedy occ
urring again
.”  She adde
d: “Toilet b

dily accessi

 children an
d these prod

igned to be 
bright, pret

particularly
 to children
.”  A paedia
tric surgeon
, Simon Keys
, told the h
earing it wa
s not certai
n that a che
mical from t
he product h
ad caused th
e injury and
 added: “If 
this is the 
explanation 
for the inju

 first time 
it’s been de
scribed.  “I
t’s a traged

t has wide i

for everybod

this type of

Grace’s moth

 Hampshire, 
described he
r daughter’s
 last moment
s. She said 
a doctor tol
d her they h
ad done all 
they could. 
“I saw Ariet

.  “Someone 
gave me Arie

 why the gir

 She said no

 but added: 
“That seemed

fter a trial
 at Winchest

 his seven-y

 on grounds 
of insuffici

 to meet a c

 Lord Burnet

was “not cap

Taken at its
 highest, th

  In the rul

“not enough”
, so the iss

He said Brou

  Richard Sm

court heard.
  Smith said
 Brehmer suf
focated Parr
y in the cro

er allegedly
 took a penk

arm and cut 
himself. The
 court was t

The prosecut

 but claimed
 he had not

, and had be
en “simply r
obustly tryi

h added: “Wh
at the prose

 told her af

 pair had be
en having an

more than 10
 years, with
 their relat

 of niceness
”.  On the r
un up to her
 death, Parr

I have since

just prior t

He revealed 
he had plann

  Brehmer, o

d that at on

tabbed his a

said he dema

refused, so 
he tried to 
push her out
 and his arm
 “must have

claimed Parr

 the fatal i

tried to pus

 drive away,
 and his arm
 “must have

d Brehmer mu

“This is a c

, rather tha
n on the bas
is that you 
had no inten

judge said. 
 “I am sure 
that you did
 deliberatel

 crook of yo
ur elbow for

minimum 10 t

 and possibl

s a “trained

rehmer would
 have known 
Parry was se

nothing to h

 judge said.
 He could no

id in his po

“simply taki

, the judge 
added.  “You
 must have k

Before you w

.  Parry had
 “fought har

 Brehmer had

 lying to po

s strangely 
isolated, a

many juggle 
two or three
 jobs, since
 wages, empl

 are all mar
kedly lower 
than in the 
rest of the

But for most
, smuggling 
has been rel
egated to mo

Today, the m

 organised c
rime – which
 is partly w

 linking the
 men, was bo
rn and raise
d on the isl
and; at tria
l, the prose
cution accep
ted that he 
was “a legit
imate lobste

. His parent
s founded Sa

 a fish shop
, then a bar
 and restaur
ant, which a
re now under

 fishing mad
 – that’s al

 “He was a r

s. At the ti

rest, Nikki,
 his wife of
 21 years an
d the mother
 of their th

, was being 
treated for 
breast cance
r.  Birtwist

 Green as a 
mentor. Now 
29, he has m
oved back ho
me with his 
mother on th
e mainland i
n Selsey, a 
seaside town
 in Sussex. 
Calm and mea
sured, he’s 
balancing hi
s wish to sp

 a wariness 
of not being

always loved
 fishing. “I
 loved the f
reedom. It d
idn’t even f

. On leaving
 school, he 
placed an ad
 on findafis
hingboat.com
. Green cont
acted him in
 December 20
09, and with
in weeks Bir
twistle had 
moved to the
 island to l
ive in a car
avan on Gree

 crew the Ga

 knew his st
uff and taug
ht me so muc
h,” he says.
 “In Selsey,
 skippers ta

 on the Isle

e’s working 
on building

 adjusting t

had been a m

 know Quint,
 the shark h

asks. “Well,

to call him 
Quint. He’d 
bark and sho
ut if you we

 his way aro

 “I’d worked

ntinues. “My

But by then,
 I was livin

   In any ca
se, the Galw
ad eventuall
y headed bac
k towards th
e island. Th
at Sunday wa
s clear and 
bright. The 
boat stayed 
out all day 
– in full vi
ew of bank h
oliday crowd
s, plus two 
police offic
ers on Tenny
son Down, a 
grassy chalk
 cliff with 
panoramic se
a views. Sho
rtly before 
the Galwad a
rrived back 
in Yarmouth,
 these polic
e officers r
adioed in an
 entry: “SU1
16 (the Galw
ad’s ID numb
er) is movin
g westbound,
 six to seve
n items over
board at int
ervals.” Gre
en has claim
ed that, if 
these “items
 overboard” 
were anythin
g, they were
 old bait an
d waste; the
 crew may ha
ve been clea
ring the boa
t at the end
 of the trip
, though he 
doesn’t reca
ll doing so.
  On arrival
 in Yarmouth
, baskets of
 lobster in 
their arms, 
they were ar
rested and t
he boat seiz
ed. Police w
ere so certa
in drugs wer
e on board t
hat Green’s 
original cha
rge sheet ci
ted “possess
ion and inte
nt to supply
”. The Galwa
d was search
ed and partl
y dismantled
. Its tank w
as pumped, a
n itemiser –
 a highly se
nsitive piec
e of police 
equipment – 
scanned ever
y inch of th
e boat, but 
no molecule 
of cocaine w
as found.  T
he following
 morning, Mo
nday 31 May, 
a lobster fi
sherman foun
d 11 holdall
s, each stac
ked with coc
aine, strung
 together on
 a rope atta
ched to a we
ighted buoy 
in Freshwate
r Bay. (It w
as an area t
oo shallow f
or the Galwa
d to have re
ached, but t
he prosecuti
on claimed t
he holdalls 
may have dri
fted.)      
   The polic
e told me I 
didn’t have 
to be in pri
son, I could
 have a new 
identity – b
ut I told th
em I didn’t 
know anythin
g       This
 is where th
e investigat
ion gets con
tentious. Th
e court hear
d that on th
e Monday mor
ning, in a p
olice operat
ion debrief,
 substantial
 amendments 
were made to
 the police 
log – so man
y that they 
became longe
r than the l
og itself. (
In court, th
e log keeper
 claimed her
 radio had s
topped worki
ng during th
e operation,
 which meant
 much had be
en missed.) 
The most cri
tical amendm
ent, and the
 only direct
 evidence li
nking the me
n to the dru
gs, was made
 by the two 
police offic
ers from Ten
nyson Down. 
Contrary to 
strict proto
col, they di
dn’t attend 
the debrief,
 but made th
is amendment
 when they m
et the surve
illance comm
ander in a c
ar park. It 
read: “The i
tems appeare
d to be dark
 in colour a
nd approxima
tely the siz
e of a large
 holdall. Th
ey were tied
 together on
 a line and 
were dispatc
hed from the
 boat one af
ter another,
 totalling 1
0-12. The la
st item was 
a red floati
ng buoy.”  H
ad Green rea
lly deposite
d this enorm
ous haul of 
cocaine when
 it was clea
r and sunny,
 in a bay wh
ere the shor
e and cliffs
 were heavin
g with peopl
e? Would an 
experienced 
fisherman le
ave the bags
 floating an
d drifting i
nstead of ca
refully anch
ored and sub
merged? And 
having witne
ssed such a 
suspicious d
eposit, woul
d police lea
ve these ite
ms in the se
a all night 
without even
 taking a ph
otograph or 
noting the G
PS? (In cour
t, one of th
e police off
icers claime
d they didn’
t have a cam
era.)  No mo
re evidence 
emerged. The
re were sate
llite calls 
made on the 
Galwad at se
a that Satur
day night – 
but their co
ntent is unk
nown. Althou
gh the cocai
ne was damp,
 suggesting 
leakage, no 
traces were 
found on the
 boat. And t
hough a guil
ty plea woul
d have subst
antially red
uced their s
entences, al
l five insis
ted they wer
e innocent. 
Before the t
rial, police
 visited Pay
ne in Parkhu
rst prison, 
offering fre
edom in exch
ange for inf
ormation, bu
t Payne insi
sted he had 
nothing to g
ive. “My gir
lfriend had 
split up wit
h me. They k
new I was st
ruggling,” h
e says. “The
y told me I 
didn’t have 
to be there,
 I could go 
wherever I w
anted, I cou
ld have a ne
w identity –
 but I told 
them I didn’
t know anyth
ing. That fi
shing trip w
as your norm
al bloody ni
ghtmare like
 every other
 fishing tri
p.”  Perhaps
 the figure 
most tenuous
ly linked to
 all this wa
s the fifth 
man, Jon Bee
re, who was 
arrested eig
ht months la
ter, then tr
ied and conv
icted alongs
ide the Galw
ad crew. Bee
re was 42, m
arried for 1
8 years to S
ue, a specia
l needs supp
ort worker, 
and father o
f Elle, Mais
ie and Flynn
. He ran a s
caffolding b
usiness and 
though, acco
rding to Sue
, Beere and 
Green weren’
t close, the
y’d known ea
ch other for
 years “as e

   For nine 
years, Sue h
as raised th
eir children
 without Bee
re. “When it
 happened, J
on had a sca
ffolding job
 on the harb
ourmaster’s 
building in 
Yarmouth, ri
ght by Jamie
’s boat,” sh
e says. The 
case against
 Beere is th
at, on Frida
y 28 May, th
e day before
 the fishing
 trip, he’d 
taken his di
stinctive pi
ck-up on the
 hovercraft 
to Portsmout
h, where he 
met Dresic, 
and delivere
d him, along
 with two as
sociates who
 were helpin
g him as the
y spoke Engl
ish, to Gree
n. The defen
ce claimed t
hat Green ha
d been at se
a, unable to
 collect thi
s potential 
crew member,
 so he’d cal
led Beere fr
om his boat 
and asked hi
m to do it a
s a favour. 
This was the
 extent of t
he case agai
nst the scaf
folder.  “Th
e biggest jo
ke is that f
or doing tha
t, he was th
e land-based
 criminal ma
stermind, th
e ‘organiser
’,” Sue says
. The prosec
ution failed
 to produce 
any phone re
cords, email
s, texts or 
other lines 
of communica
tion between
 Beere and w
hoever was s
upplying the
 drugs from 
abroad, or a
ny other net
work, other 
than these t
wo men. “Jon
’s the most 
disorganised
 person I kn
ow,” Sue con
tinues. “His
 filing syst
em is Tesco 
bags tied wi
th a knot, o
r telephone 
numbers scri
bbled on scr
aps of paper
. He used to
 drive his p
oor secretar
y round the

as very much
 part of the
 community –
 he’d do any
thing for an
yone. He wou
ldn’t just g
ive you a li
ft, he’d len
d you his ca
r. He was a 
decent bloke
. I talk lik
e he’s dead!
 But it’s so
 hard, becau
se every asp
ect of life 
hasn’t been 
the same sin
ce.”  ***  T
he Freshwate

al took plac
e in Kingsto
n upon Thame
s, Soca’s ho
me turf, tho
ugh the defe
nce team had
 pushed for 
it to be hel
d locally, o
r somewhere 
jurors might
 understand 
conditions a
t sea. “Desp
ite that, we
 still went 
into it beli
eving it wou
ld all be re
solved, that
 in a minute
 someone wou
ld see sense
,” Nicky Gre
en says. “Yo
u’re in this
 arena, you 
don’t know t
he rules, an
d you don’t 
see the stea
m train comi
ng at you.” 
Although the
 judge’s fin
al summary a
ppeared to p
our doubt on
 much of the
 evidence – 
referring to
 the “large 
number of ad
ditions and 
alterations”
 to the poli
ce log and t
he “extraord
inary” accou
nt from Tenn
yson Down – 
the jury rea
ched a guilt
y verdict wi
th a majorit
y of 11 to on
e.         I
f it was a y
ear in priso
n, I’d have 
been devasta
ted, but 24?
 How could I
 tell the ch
ildren? How 
was I going 
to cope?    
   “It was l
ike one of t
hose films w
here the who
le tone chan
ges, like so
meone has fl
icked a swit
ch,” Nicky s
ays. “There 
was this hug
e rush of em
otion. Sue w
as howling. 
Nikki was ho
wling. You’r
e picking up
 all these b
roken people
 around you.
”  The sente
nces followe
d that same 
day, the har
shest reserv
ed for Green
, Beere and 
Dresic, who 
were seen as
 more deeply
 involved. “
I remember h
earing ‘24 y
ears’,” Sue 
says. “It’s 
such a huge 
number. If i
t had been a
 year, I’d h
ave been dev
astated, but
 24? How was
 I going to 
tell the chi
ldren? How w
as I going t
o cope? What
 about the b
usiness? Wha
t about the 
house? What 
about… us?” 
 How has she
 coped? “I d
on’t know ho
w I’ve got t
hrough it, i
f I’m honest
,” she says.
 “Support, l

When Jon was

For 18 month

attended her

here were ab

to hug him,”
 Nicky says.
 “Fair play

 in a sexual

 was so viol

CJ, two week

 was killed.
  She moved 
into their o
ne-bedroomed
 flat after 
quarrelling 
in April wit
h her mother
, Rebecca Co

e she wanted
 to spend mo

 her boyfrie

tickled” and
 had “playfi

lirted” with
 her by putt
ing his arm 
around her a

 court heard
.  On 8 May, 
the defendan
t allegedly 
led the coll

to a woodlan
d site, Hava

and murdered
 her.  Newto
n-Price said
: “The prose
cution submi

. A determin

ad been made
 to destroy 
her body, wh

” occurred i
n October 20

 to as Child

a property t
aken over by
 drug dealer
s, often inh
abited by a 
vulnerable t
enant – in B
ournemouth w

oodie at the
 property in
 personal po
ssession of 
39 wraps of 
crack cocain

He was suspe

 his grandmo
ther’s home 
in Waltham F
orest at 3am
.  The coord

ervices betw
een Bournemo

on was not a
s strong as 
it could hav
e been, the 
report said,
 calling thi
s a “reachab
le moment”, 
based on a c
oncept in ed
ucation that
 describes a
n unplanned 
chance for a
 breakthroug
h with a chi
ld.  “The re
sponse to Ch
ild C while 
detained in 
Bournemouth 
and then on 
his return f
rom there in
 October 201
8 did not ca
pitalise on 
a ‘reachable

 a child who
 was clearly
 being crimi

 was all the
 information
 available f
rom the auth

While the im
portance of 
maximising t

 of reachabl

s beginning

is as yet no

om 2011 to 20
18, Moodie a
nd his famil

g in Notting
hamshire. Fr
om 2016, he b
egan to have
 a troubled 
time at seco
ndary school
, leading to
 suspensions
 and other d
isciplinary 
measures. Hi
s mother dec
ided to educ
ate him at h
ome from 201
7, and he wa
s then at ho
me for more 
than a year.
  However, b
y the end of
 the summer 
of 2017 these
 arrangement

ning to brea
k down, even
tually leavi
ng Moodie wi
th a lot of 
unsupervised
 time, a pat
tern that re
peated at re
gular interv

rest of his 
life.  In Ap

 mother deci
ded to move 
him to Walth

 live initia

 grandmother
 while she a
pplied to be
 rehoused in
 Waltham For

year-old was
 sleeping on
 a sofa at h

, who was st

The serious

pent all but
 three of hi

school and f
or much of t

 there was a

  Unlike in 
the US, anti

so far been 
minimal in t

d that while
 it did not 
believe the

were organis

did say ther
e was a big 
risk of cros
s-pollinatio
n, partly be
cause of the
 narratives 
being promot

e groups.  P
atrik Herman

, said: “We 
already see

, and last y
ear among si

from the far

had more tim

from Kirkdal

 Dalglish st
and that day
, as he was 
for every  L

 ticket hold

ad been atte

as a teenage
r. His uncle
 would take 
him to watch
 the Reds, b
ack when Eve
rton were th
e more succe
ssful club, 
and the Blue
s fans would
 give them s
tick.    He 
had been at 
Hillsborough
 in Sheffiel
d on 15 April
 1989, too, 
 when 96 peop
le died as a
 result of a
 crush insid
e the stadiu
m  before Li
verpool were
 due to play
 Nottingham 
Forest in an
 FA Cup semi
-final. Rich
ie and his s
on, Jamie, n
ow 48, were 
in the stand
 directly ab
ove the crus

everything. 
At home, Ric
hie’s wife, 
Mary, watche
d, appalled,
 as the disa
ster unfolde
d on TV. She
 saw ashen-f
aced men and
 boys clawin
g their way 
over the fen
ce and colla
psing on the
 pitch. Then
 she saw Jam
ie and Richi
e, hauling p
eople up to 
the safety o
f their stan
d, and she k
new that the
y were safe.
  When the p
olice came r
ound to inte
rview them a
fterwards, J
amie says he
 had never s
een his fath
er so angry.
  ***  Richi
e set out fr
om the flat 
he shared in
 Kirkdale wi
th Mary, 72,
 just after 
6.30pm on th
e day of the
 Atlético ma
tch. It was 
a little ear
lier than us
ual, because
 a friend ha
d given him 
a spare tick
et for the h
ospitality l
ounge and he
 planned to 
eat before t
he game – th
e club usual
ly laid on a
 carvery.  R
ichie and Ma
ry would hav
e celebrated
 their 50th 
wedding anni
versary on 1
 August. The
y met on the
 No 3 bus. R
ichie was a 
bus conducto
r; Mary work
ed at the Br
itish Americ
an Tobacco c
igarette fac
tory. “Every
 time I got 
on the bus, 
he would ask
 me out,” Ma
ry remembers
. “I would s
ay: ‘Go away
 now!’’’ Mar
ket stallhol
ders would r
ide the bus 
with crates 
of flowers a
nd Richie wo
uld persuade
 them to giv
e him daffod
ils or tulip
s to present
 to Mary. Sh
e relented; 
they got mar
ried in thei
r early 20s.
 “In them da
ys, that was
 kind of old
,” Mary says
.         On
 holiday, Ri
chie would r
ise early an
d bolt for t
he sun loung
ers       It
 was a happy
 marriage. “
I liked ever
ything about
 him,” she s
ays. “He was
 just a good
 person.” Ri
chie became 
a train driv
er for Merse
yrail and Ma
ry a care wo
rker. Workin
g on the tra

suicides. He
 once had to
 climb on to
 the tracks 
to turn off 
the power af
ter a young 
girl jumped.
 “He never t
ook time off
,” Mary says
. “Maggie Th
atcher had r
uined all th
e jobs. You 
were lucky t
o have one i
n those days
.”  Richie l
oved family,
 holidays, L
iverpool FC 
and horse ra
cing – in mo
re or less t
hat order. M
ost of the t
ime, the fam
ily went to 
Spain. “Ever
y year, he’d
 be on the p
hone, harass
ing me to bo
ok the holid
ay for that 
year,” says 
Jamie. “‘Com
e on!’ he’d 
say. ‘Have y
ou booked it
 yet? We’re 
going to mis
s out!” When
 away, in ti
me-honoured 
tourist fash
ion, Richie 
would rise e
arly and bol
t for the su
n loungers. 
“He was terr
ible,” says 
Jamie. “It w
as the most 
embarrassing
 thing ever.
 He’d wait t
here with hi
s towel. My 
daughter fil
med him once
, at six in 
the morning,
 running to 
get the sunb
eds with all
 the other t
ourists. He 
was out in f
ront.”  If R
ichie had a 
weakness, it
 was his lov
e of betting
, although h
e never spen
t more than 
he could aff
ord, putting
 down only 5
0p or £1 on 
a bet. “Noth
ing went sho
rt in this h
ouse,” Mary 
says. “You c
ouldn’t argu
e about it.”
 He could al
so be grumpy
. “Me dad wa
s a terrible
 moaner,” sa
ys Jamie, la
ughing. Rich
ie moaned th
e most when 
his horses w
ere losing. 
“I’ll be hon
est with you
, he was abs
olutely usel
ess,” says h
is friend Jo
hn Gallagher
, 69, a busi
ness owner. 
“He couldn’t
 pick a hors
e. He was th
e worst gamb
ler I ever m
et.”  Richie
 was cheerfu
l, popular, 
well turned 
out. He shin
ed his shoes
, even if he
 was only ta
king the dog
 for a walk.
 He always d
id the washi
ng-up. He we
nt to the gy
m twice a we
ek. He was n
ever cruel, 
although he 
often made f
un of Mary, 
especially w
hen she was 
taking too l
ong at the s
hops and he 
wanted to go
 home. He wa
s a good hus
band. “Richi
e was sound 
as a pound,”
 says John. 
“He loved li

 But as Rich

still saying
 that mass e

 says now. “

s that the L

may have led
 to an extra
 41 Covid-19

nearly half 
the death to

As he walked
 to the Dark
 House after
 the game, R
ichie called
 Jamie, who 
had been wat
ching at hom
e. It was a 
routine of t
heirs: they 
always debri
efed after a
 match. Live
rpool played
 well, they 
agreed, but 
Atlético put
 up a stunni
ng defence t
o win 3-2 and
 dump Liverp
ool out of t
he competiti
on. Richie w
as optimisti
c about thei
r Premier Le
ague prospec
ts, though. 
“He said: ‘I
 think we’re
 going to wi
n the league
,’” Jamie re
members.  In
side the Dar
k House, the
 bar manager
, Elaine McC
ormack, 47, 
was waiting 
for the foot
ball crowd t
o pile in. R
ichie was a 
regular; Ela
ine had know
n him since 
she was 14 a
nd started h
elping her m
um and dad b
ehind the ba
r. When Elai
ne’s daughte
r Connie, 20
, served him
, he would t
ip her a pou
nd coin as s
he handed hi
m his Carlin
g and say: “
Here you are
, my little 
mate.”      
   At the cr
ematorium, t
hey played Y
ou’ll Never 
Walk Alone. 
Outside, eve
ryone sang a
long – even 
the Everton 
fans       R
ichie always
 came into t
he Dark Hous
e on Sunday 
afternoons, 
after he had
 finished ru
nning his gr
anddaughter,
 Nicole, 16,
 around town
. Richie ado
red Nicole a
nd talked ab
out her cons
tantly. Afte
r he dropped
 her off, he
 would sit a
nd watch the
 horse racin
g with John,
 occasionall
y running ou
t of the pub
 to place wa
gers at the 
betting shop
 around the 
corner. Some
times, if it
 was quiet, 
Elaine would
 come over t
o their tabl
e, which wou
ld be covere
d in betting
 slips. “I’d
 say: ‘No on
e winning on
 this table?
’” Elaine re
calls. “He’d
 say: ‘Not t
oday. I back
ed the favou
rite!”  Elai
ne saw Richi
e come in th
at evening a
fter the gam
e, although 
she can’t re
member if sh
e served him
. She may ha
ve swerved h
im: Richie w
as always a 
pain to serv
e, because h
e held the k
itty for his
 friends and
 placed huge
 orders, oft
en eight or 
nine pints a
t a time. He
 always trie
d to skip th
e queue, too
 – the perks
 of being a 
regular. He 
always got a
way with it,
 too, becaus
e everyone k
new Richie a
t the Dark H
ouse and eve
ryone liked 
him. “He was
 always poli
te, Richie,”
 says Sandra
. “He’d neve
r walk past 
you without 
saying hello
. Never ever
. He’d alway
s let on to 
you, no matt
er what.”  W
hile Richie 
drank his Ca

 “I’m tearin

  At 11pm, la

 out to Rich

” Mary remem

She told her
self that it
 could not b

the girl was
 letting on.
 “But them w

 On 26 March

f a cold. Ma

hanged the b

 She prescri

 was stricke

 The paramed

 We do not k
now for cert
ain when Ric
hie contract
ed Covid-19.
 What we do 
know is that
, on the nig
ht of the ma
tch at Anfie
ld, Covid-19
 was silentl
y replicatin
g across the
 UK. It was 
finding its 
way into car
e homes, hos
pitals and s
chools. Givi
ng evidence 
to parliamen
t on 10 June,
 Ferguson sa
id that  inf
ection rates
 were doubli
ng every thr
ee to four d
ays in mid-M
arch . “Had 
we introduce
d lockdown m
easures a we
ek earlier, 
we would hav
e reduced th
e final deat
h toll by a 
half,” he sa
id.  After R
ichie became
 infected wi
th Covid-19,
 the virus b
urrowed into
 the cells o
f his upper 
respiratory 
tract and re
plicated. Hi
s immune sys
tem was not 
able to figh
t off the vi
rus and went
 into overdr
ive. His lun
gs began to 
fill with wa
ter, which i
s why Richie
 could not b
reathe when 
he spoke to 
Jamie on the
 afternoon o
f 3 April. “
He was sayin
g: ‘I can’t 
get my breat
h,’” Jamie r
emembers. “I
 said: ‘Dad,
 leave it, w
e’ll phone y
ou back.’”  
When Jamie c
alled back t
he following
 day, Richie
 was on a ve
ntilator. He
 would remai
n on the ven
tilator for 
more than tw
o weeks.  **
*  As Richie
 lay in hosp
ital and the
 scale of th
e loss of li
fe was becom
ing clear, t
he finger-po
inting began
. On 2 April
, Matthew As
hton, the in
coming publi
c health dir
ector for Li
verpool,  to
ld the Guard
ian       th
at  “it was 
not the righ
t decision t
o stage the 
match”. On 1
9 April, the
 mayor of Ma
drid  admitt
ed that it w
as a “mistak
e”  to allow
 Atlético fa
ns into the 
UK. On 20 Ap
ril, a repor

 Liverpool E

ked at a Dow

press confer
ence whether
 the governm

“That is cer
tainly an in
teresting hy
pothesis you
 raise,”  re
sponded Prof
 Dame Angela
 McLean , th
e UK governm
ent’s deputy
 chief scien
tific advise

ril, Jamie r
eceived a ca
ll from the 
staff at Ain
tree hospita
l. Richie wa
s not improv

hospital wan
ted to take 
him off the 
ventilator. 
Jamie pleade
d with the d
octors for m
ore time and
 they agreed
 to give Ric
hie two more
 days. On 16
 April, they
 called back
. It was tim
e for the fa
mily to say 
their goodby
es. A nurse 
video-called
 Mary, Jamie
, his wife C
hristine and
 Nicole, who
 were assemb
led at Jamie
’s and Chris
tine’s house
.  Nurses tr
ied to sit R
ichie uprigh
t, but he wa
s unconsciou
s, with tube
s coming fro
m his mouth 
and nose. Hi
s mouth was 
agape and hi
s face bloat
ed. The call
 lasted only
 10 minutes,
 because “ev
eryone was s
creaming and
 crying”, sa
ys Mary. “To
 say goodbye
 over a vide
o link – I h
ave never go
ne through a
n emotion li
ke that,” sa
ys Jamie. “I
 wouldn’t wi
sh it on my 
worst enemy.
 Words canno
t describe i
t. How can y
ou say goodb
ye over a vi
deo link?”  
After the ca
ll, the fami
ly begged th
e hospital s
taff not to 
leave Richie
 alone. A nu
rse promised
 to hold his
 hand throug
h the night.
 Richie died
 at about 3a
m.  ***  Ric
hie’s funera
l was held o
n 2 May. It 
was beautifu
l, even if t
he lockdown 
restrictions
 meant that 
only 10 peopl
e could atte

earse pulled
 out from Ri
chie’s home 
in Kirkdale,
 his neighbo
urs applaude
d him down t
he street. O
n the way to
 the cremato
rium, the he
arse waited 
outside Anfi
eld for two 
            
  ‘I liked e
verything ab
out him. He 
was just a g
ood person’ 
... Mary and
 Richie.  Ph

they were ap
proaching th
e crematoriu
m, Mary turn
ed to Jamie 
and said: “T
here’s a lot
 of people a
t that bus s
top.” When t
hey got clos
er, they rea
lised that t
he socially 
distanced cr
owd of 200 p
eople was th
ere for Rich
ie. The fune
ral director
 turned on t
he speakers,
 so that the
 crowd outsi

coffin disap
peared behin
d the curtai

 roses – red
, of course 
– they playe
d You’ll Nev

everyone san

 their hands
 in the air,
 even the Ev

 Leaving the
 crematorium
, the mourne

ggested they
 clap the we
ll-wishers, 
so they star
ted clapping
 them. They 
clapped back
 and then ev
eryone was c
lapping. “It
 was lovely,
” says Mary.
 Richie’s as
hes now sit 
in a wooden 
casket with 
a Liverpool 
crest on it 
at Jamie’s h

ary dies, sh
e will be cr
emated and t
heir ashes w
ill be burie

 In the week
s after Rich
ie’s death, 
Jamie and Ma
ry grew angr
ier. By this
 point, the 
fault lines 
in the gover
nment’s hand
ling of the 
pandemic wer
e so big tha
t you could 
see them fro
m space. “Th
e government
 acted too s
low on every
thing,” says
 Mary. “And 
now they’re 
telling lies
. They’re pa
tting themse
lves on the 
back about h
ow well they
’ve handled 
things. They
 must think 
people are f
oolish enoug
h to believe
 them.” At a
 Downing Str
eet press co
nference on 
30 April,  B
oris Johnson
 defended hi
s decision  
not to lock 
down the UK 
sooner. “We 
did the righ

ted.  A team

 Liverpool F

March.  Almo
st everyone 
in Liverpool
, it seems, 
knows someon
e who has di

were saying:
 ‘I don’t kn
ow anyone wh
o’s got it,’
” says Mary.
 “And then, 
all of a sud
den, everyon

 and everyon

” At the beg

have a cocku
p, it’s not 
normally one
 thing going
 wrong, but 
a number of 
things going

hey all come
 together,” 
says Ashton.
 As with Hil
lsborough, t
he decision 
to let the A
tlético game
 go ahead wa
s a baton re
lay of misst
eps, each mi
stake passed
 off to the 
next hand, b
ut all conve
rging at the
 same time. 
“You had the
 epidemic in
 Spain, you 
had inactivi
ty at a nati
onal level, 
you had the 
financial pr
essures for 
the game to 
go ahead and
 the passion
 for the gam
e in the cit

ays.  “What 
is the job o
f a minister
 for culture
?” Ashton as
ks. “Shouldn
’t they be p
roviding ove
rsight? What
 about Uefa?
 The club it
self could h
ave been mor

” Uefa, the 
administrati

European foo
tball, which
 organised t
he Liverpool
-Atlético ga
me, distance
d itself fro
m the decisi
on to go ahe
ad with the 
game in a st
atement  to 
the Liverpoo
l Echo . “An

aken by Uefa
 which led t

behind close

taken in clo
se collabora
tion with, a
nd based on 
decisions ma

respective h

 “Uefa did n

  Already, t
here are ind
ications tha
t the govern

 said: “We f

 Kay Burley,
 responded: 
“You can’t s

         We’

   Across Li

re are calls
 for an inve

enough to pr

large scale 
gatherings,”
 says Liverp
ool’s metro 
mayor, Steve
 Rotheram. “
We’ve been h

mie and Mary
 back the ca

’m not just 
doing this f
or my dad, b

 with Hillsb

pandemic has
 scarred the
 city. “Scou

” says Ashto
n. “It will 
be in there.
” It may be 
years before
 the city re

says Mary. “
We’ve all go

 Tanker Mana

said stowawa

ed the tanke

and that as 
the ship app

 happened on
 the vessel 
on Sunday. O
ne source sa
id crew memb

hemselves in
 the control

  Defence so
urces sought
 to justify 
the deployme

 One insider
 said a “thr

 had been co

the Ministry
 of Defence 
described th
e situation 
onboard as “
a suspected 
hijacking”. 
But Bob Sang
uinetti, the
 chief execu
tive of the 
UK Chamber o
f Shipping, 
said he thou
ght that was
 not the cas
e. “Nothing 
at this stag
e suggests t
hat this was
 hijacking, 
and in fact 
hijacking of
 this nature
 is extremel
y uncommon,”
 he told the
 BBC.  Chris
 Parry, a re
tired rear a
dmiral, said
: “They will
 have wanted
 to send a m
essage here:
 if you try 
to take cont
rol of a tan
ker, there w
ill be a res
ponse.”  The
 228-metre t
anker had be
en expected 
to dock in S
outhampton o
n Sunday to 
pick up a ca

l, but its c

ame erratic,
 prompting c

in the whole

cidents such
 as the one 
on Sunday ar

 is unclear 
if the seven

wan Thompson
, 17, had ju
st returned 
from a jog w
ith Joanna T
hompson when
 they attack
ed her at he
r home in th
e Hampshire 
village of H
ambledon.   
 The teenage
r strangled 
Ms Thompson,
 a 50-year-o
ld speech th
erapist, in 
her living r
oom until sh
e fell uncon
scious befor
e stabbing h
er in the ne
ck, forehead
 and arm.  A
t 12.45pm on 
1 July last 
year, Rowan 
phoned the p
olice and an
nounced: “I’
ve just kill
ed my mum … 
I strangled 
her and I’ve
 been stabbi
ng her with 
various kniv
es and whatn
ot.”  Rowan 
was due to s
tand trial a
t Winchester
 crown court
 in October 
but was foun
d dead at a 
secure hospi
tal in Great
er Mancheste
r a few days
 before. Pol
ice said the
 death was n
ot suspiciou
s.  Speaking
 outside cou
rt, Rowan’s 
father, Marc
, claimed mo
re could hav
e been done 
for the teen
ager during 
stays at two
 mental heal
th units bef
ore the atta
ck. He said 
Rowan identi
fied as non-
binary but w
as placed in
to a unit th
at segregate
d boys and g
irls.  Mr Th
ompson said 
Rowan was “t
roubled” and
 had been fa
iled by the 
system. He s
aid Rowan ha
d loved Ms T
hompson “to 
bits” and kn
ew the attac
k was wrong.
  Before the
 attack, Row
an was never
 aggressive,
 liked fenci
ng, climbing
, the Rubik’
s Cube and w
anted to bec
ome an archi
tect, Mr Tho
mpson added.
  The inques
t was told t
hat Rowan wa
s visiting t
heir mother 
for the week
end, having 
moved to liv
e with their
 father, a m
agician, in 
Barnsley, so
uth Yorkshir
e.  Rowan an
d their moth
er had “stre
ssful” conve
rsations abo
ut living ar
rangements o
n the night 
before her d
eath, the in
quest in Win
chester was 
told.  In a 
clip of the 
999 call pla
yed in court
, the teenag
er can be he
ard saying: 
“I’ve just k
illed my mum
. I need som
eone to arre
st me as tha
t’s what you
 do and an a
mbulance wou

I strangled 
her and I’ve

t breathing 
… bring a bo
dy-bag or wh
atever you d
o. I’m 99.9%
 sure she’s 
not breathin
g.”  The tee
nager told p
olice they f
elt “strange
” and was on
 “auto-pilot
” at the tim
e of the att
ack.  Dr Bas
il Purdue, a
 pathologist
, concluded 
that althoug
h Ms Thompso
n was uncons
cious, her h
eart was sti

hen Rowan st
abbed her 11

 John Sandfo

Zdun, 18, aft
er his wife 
ordered him 
to leave hom

he wanted a

 court heard
.    The wom

d critically
 injured at

n Salisbury 
on 1 June. W
hen Zdun, a

 scene of th

police found
 a folding l

 his trouser
 pocket with

 40,  admits
 killing the

 , claiming 
he has no re

an “abnormal

 she was fin

 was subsequ

to leave the

d a number o

this was a “

ng a “contro

”, and he co
mplained tha
t his wife w
as spending 
too much mon
ey and givin
g their daug

.  The prose
cutor said 1
 June was a 
“special dat

“It is known

 “At some po

 Opening the
 case agains
t them, Jaso
n Beer QC sa
id: “It was 
a unit that 
was racist –
 a black off
icer is desc
ribed as a ‘
pavement spe

mixed-breed 
dog. People 
are describe
d as ‘pikeys

o a black of

on a fake Ca

 he was from
 Ghana. A de
tail like th
at doesn’t m

s a black ma

  “A black o

England from

the time a s

ed that “off

os of black 
men were sha
red on a Wha

in reference
 to the only
 black offic

it.  Beer al
so said the 
unit display
ed sexism: “
Women were c

‘whores’, ‘s

 ‘Dorises’, 
‘a fucking D

 was also sa
id that “ill

the death pe
nalty”, Beer
 told the he
aring. “The 
officers jok
ed about imm
igrants havi
ng a ‘long s

dded: “It wa
s a unit tha
t was plain

aid the unit
 enjoyed rel
ative isolat

 rest of the

o the sensit

times covert
 nature of i
ts work.  “T

which uncove

 said.  Acro
ss the UK, b

 on the rise
, according 
to  BikeRegi

database, wh
ich helps po
lice to iden

figures sugg
est  the eas

coincided wi
th a huge sp

crime that c
ontinued thr
oughout the 
summer, as p

 to avoid pu
blic transpo

 increased .
 In August a
lone, the da

tered 932 the

of 59% on la
st year’s fi
gures.  But 
at the same 
time, BikeRe
gister is al
so receiving
 more report
s of people 
getting thei
r stolen bik

 Facebook  g
roups. “I’m 
not surprise
d these grou

y, with most

eft doesn’t 
get to the t

  In Cambrid

cycle theft 
is the numbe

0 people hav

will start k

“It’s workin

just 70 peopl

ge, more tha
n 90% of cyc

or help. He

. “[However]
 I think the

In Bristol, 
John Kelly h
elps to run

Facebook gro
up  with 2,0

which he say
s was starte
d “out of fr

locally and 
a lack of po

 “We’re just
 a group of

o the same.”
  There are 
two main way

ays. One met

 an owner po

the bike for
 a “test cyc
