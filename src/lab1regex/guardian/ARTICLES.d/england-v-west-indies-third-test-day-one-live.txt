A good day’s work for England:  runs in the bank and for the two men who hadn’t passed fifty this summer - an unbroken partnership of 136. Buttler had an understandably wary start but freed the shoulders with those two sixes off Cornwall and looked increasingly confident. Pope was all ease and poise and timing. He sleeps, nine short of his century.  
Jason Holder’s decision to bowl first hasn’t paid off but they still have the morning, and they still have the new ball, and they still have the England tail. Kemar Roach was the pick of the bowlers.  
Thanks for all your emails, sorry I couldn’t use them all, time for me to make the schlep to the kitchen for a Friday night schlurp. Good night!

STUMPS England 258-4 (Buttler 56, Pope 91) 
That’s that then folks.  The hover covers float into place and England will be hoping that weather forecast bucks up. A reminder that batsmen can’t accept or decline the light any more, it’s purely the umpires’ decision.  
A hoarse sounding Ollie Pope is being interviewed.  “Jos is a nice guy to bat with, he doesn’t need me telling him how to bat. The pitch spun a little bit, still a little bit of nip in it for the bowlers, a pretty good wicket, not as much pace as we thought. The West Indies have looked after the ball well.  
“ [Getting 90] does feel like a little bit of weight off the shoulders, with the pandemic we haven’t played cricket for a while. In such an intense environment, we haven’t been able to get out and see our family, we go back into the hotel room and look out over the cricket pitch. To be honest I have found it a little bit challenging, you just end up playing dismissals over and over again. “

Bad light stops play 
85.4 over: England 258-4 (Buttler 56, Pope 91)    After four dot balls, the umpires draw together like a couple of shifty looking dealers . From a mile away, it doesn’t seem particularly dark, but their light meters say otherwise. Pope and Buttler trot off happy with their afternoon’s work. West Indies, denied their new ball, are not so merry.

85th over: England 258-4 (Buttler 56, Pope 91)    Roach has Pope in a touch of trouble. Pope pushes him awkwardly just short of the cover fielder and pulls at a bouncer rather wildly, but to the final ball he storms into the 90s with an on-drive. (an irrelevant aside: I never find an on-drive as easy on the eye as an off-drive) 
Good afternoon Tanya, writes Geoff Wignall, “Too late now to advise you to plead a typo - schlepping for skelping. Jos Buttler is as fine a skelper as you’ll find, but he’ll never be anywhere near as good a keeper as Foakes which is one reason the doubters will continue to doubt. “

84th over: England 252-4 (Buttler 55, Pope 85)  Gabriel hurtles in; his first ball flies aimlessly past Buttler’s off stump. And so it continues for the rest of the over. 
Some Buttlerstatism: this is Buttler’s 17th 50 in Test cricket, only five times has he reached fifty in fewer than 80 balls. Basically, he’s more of a classical Test batsman in Tests than you think. The question is whether he  should  be forcing himself into that mode 
James Philpot is pondering the unkind Manchester weather:  “Presumably, the England dressing room is aware of the forecast for the next few days - how heavily do you think that will weigh in their minds, given the fact that England have to force a result? #Batdeep doesn’t seem to be applicable any more given the heavy bowling lineup, if England sneak up towards 300 tonight, could we see an overnight declaration? “  
I  think  they’d rather bat “big” and gamble on bowling the Windies out twice?

“I’m not really a Buttler sceptic or detractor (I tend to hope that whoever is playing does well, since that generally me as that the team does), but I think that the number that Buttler needs is three or four’”  writes Chris Howell.   “As in, three or four innings of substance in the remaining tests this summer. It’s a little unfair, in that his 35 at Southampton was overshadowed by the collapse going on around him, while the 40 last game here was overshadowed by what had gone before. It’s good to see him currently being involved in a partnership that is changing the nature of the game England’s way, as he does so often in limited overs matches.”

It hit him plump on the front leg, but the review assumes some MASSIVE turn that has the ball ripping past leg. Not out and West Indies lose a review.  
Should we be faced with an appeal by Gabriel over a decision regarding Pope, should the umpires refer the appeal to Upstairs, as unopposed to merely upstairs?  asks Andrew Tyacke.  And how will the decision be conveyed to the field umpires? Personally I favour a thunderbolt to strike the one in the wrong but maybe a short chorus from a celestial choir might be more in keeping with the tranquil nature of cricketing tradition.

“What number will satisfy Buttler sceptics?”  asks Will Wiles . It may not last but so far this is a proper Test innings from Buttler.   For me anything more than 50 and he’s done enough to quiet the detractors for the rest of the summer. He’s applying himself to the red ball and needs time and experience just like the top order.”   
Fifty would save him for the summer but not quiet the doubters. A hundred would buy him till the winter tour.

To add to the pedantry: did you mean “to the manner born”, as in Hamlet Act 1, Scene 4 (“But to my mind, though I am native here / And to the manner born...”)? Or is this a pun on Pope’s Chelsea beginnings?   
And Graeme Thorn: 
Whilst we’re talking language and pedantry, the phrase is “to the manner born”, ultimately deriving from Hamlet. “To the Manor Born” was the sitcom with the punning title referring to this phrase.

63rd over: England 173-4 (Buttler 12, Pope 51)  Pope pretties up fifty with another boundary, a powerful off drive, his sixth boundary of the innings. He really is to the manor born. 
It appears my German GCSE has let me down. I’m handing this over to you.  
First Andrew Leal : ”I hate to be pedantic, but what the heck. „Schleppen“ actually means to tow in German rather than to toe, which puts a slightly different perspective on Burns‘s shot.”  
And Timothy Reston: “ In German “schleppen” does not mean “toe” but rather “tow”. So might be used most appropriately for a pull shot.”  
Adrian Goldman with the Yiddish angle.  “I think we should also point out that the word in English, derives from Yiddish, as in the phrase “schlepping tons of extra baggage to the airport”. - dragging it along the ground.  
Which is truly an astonishing way to play a cricket shot, and implies that he actually walked alongside the ball all the way to boundary. I believe this is against the rules of cricket?

David Keech writes.  “Schleps” is derived from the German word “Scleppen”. It has a ton of different meanings in German but the official English translation is “toe”. So “Burns toes it to the boundary”???  
Would it be terribly remiss to admit I can’t actually remember the stroke in forensic detail now? But I don’t think a toeing does it justice.

Try using the phrase ‘juicy half volley’ to a non-cricket enthusiast and seeing their reaction.

Lords 1986 against India, England played Derek Pringle at 6 and John Emburey in the first innings and Paul Downton in the second at 7. Pringle scored his only Test 50. Neither he, Downton or Emburey ever managed a hundred. Either way, our current line up looks an absolute tower of strength by comparison...    
So true, though I remember with some affection Emburey sweeping in his visored helmet, presumably taught by his great mate Goochie.

“Quite what one calls them is (as we have learned) open to question, but have England ever fielded a No6 and 7 with just two Test centuries between them in 133 innings?” challenges Gary Naylor. “Centuries shape innings and England might be hearing ‘Last Orders’ in the saloon already. Hard to win Tests if your order is 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 8, 8, 8, 10, 11, 11.”

39th over: England 99-3 (Burns 48, Pope 4)  Now it’s Pope’s turn for a concussion test after being hit on the helmet by Roach. He tried to pull and was beaten for pace, but he’s fine to continue. Burns then works a couple into the leg side to move within two of a patient fifty. 
“Here’s Tom Bowtell. “I note that you demurely wrote: ‘Imran from 1982-92 (51 with the bat, 20 with the ball from memory)’ in over 29; when we all know that stat has been tattooed on your thigh since 1997.” 
You’re wrong. What makes that stat even more impressive is that it’s been tattooed on my thigh since 19 8 7.

37th over: England 93-3 (Burns 46, Pope 1)  Pope, inexplicably scoreless in this series so far, works his first ball for a single to get off the mark. Roach, who was having a barren spell of his own until recently, has good figures of 10.4-1-23-2.  
“Interesting comment from Peter Williams,” says David Murray. “But surely, no matter what the stats say, Botham was a better batsman than Imran Khan, and Khan was a better bowler.” 
They sort of overlapped, didn’t they? I’d say Beefy was the better batsman up until around 1984, though I haven’t checked the data. It’s hard to judge Beefy because his numbers towards the end were relatively diabolical, which makes it even funnier that he managed to ruin Australia armed with little more than aura, a mullet and long hops.

36th over: England 92-3 (Burns 46, Pope 0)  Rahkeem Cornwall continues to Burns, who comes down the track and drives straight to mid-on. A maiden. Cornwall’s five-step walk-up means he gets through his overs so quickly, which is particularly useful when you are on the hunt at the other end.

35th over: England 92-3 (Burns 46, Pope 0)  “My Dear Rob,” says Robert Wilson. “Cricketing taxonomy is an innocent enough vice, (so and so is a lower-order biffer, thingamyjig is a left-arm trundler and Phil Edmonds was something we never understood). We all do it. But Kapil Dev resists all classifications bar one. Kapil was quite simply the most exhausted-looking cricketer in history. That’s because he  was  the most exhausted cricketer ever. To do him justice you need to be slightly disobliging about the Indian ‘pace’ attack of the era. Because he was it. For nearly a decade, he was an international strike force all on his own. His moustache didn’t droop that way because of fashion, it was the relentless gravity of uttermost (and sometimes thankless) effort. It was noble, magnificent and caused worship in all boyish hearts. To call such a man an all-rounder is near libellous. Kapil Dev looked permanently knackered because he  was  permanently knackered. He was a whole team. He gets his own genus.”
